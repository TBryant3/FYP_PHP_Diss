# Dissertation - PRCO304 Computing Project

Context
-
For my Final Year Project (FYP) I will be creating a Code Learning application that will be able to aid new and existing users to the concepts of what makes good coding practice as well as give a broad spectrum of different uses and applications of said coding languages.

My FYP is aimed for all ages and will include descriptions on each language that will be taught with the use of Quizzes and 'Test your knowledge' to help with solidifying the knowledge gained from the application. I wanted to add these features as I found from personal experience that these are very good to see what areas the user is good at and where they need to make improvements.

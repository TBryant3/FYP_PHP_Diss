Teaching Coding
---------------
This project will set out to explore and implement an application to support learning the basics for programming as part of a research project around computer science education. Students whilst they are learning how to code need instant feedback.  This project is to explore the use of appropriate unit tests and other mechanisms to provide that feedback.In this project the student will be required to first investigate the principles behind good computer science teaching.  From there a set of core requirements will be identified, and a proposed design of aweb application put together.  The application will be implemented and then evaluated.There is the potential for the work to be publishedas a piece of research into computer science teaching.
